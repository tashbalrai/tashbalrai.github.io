## FRONTEND OPTIMIZATION
- Load assets from multiple domains, use CDN.
- Reduce number of libraries to fewer libraries.
- Use non-blocking javascript where possible.
- Validate HTML make sure HTML tags nesting is proper.
- Website design should use less images and more colors.
- Utilize browser caching for static assets which are not dynamic in nature.
- Try not to use WebFonts, extra HTTP request and data transfer
- Reduce 301 redirects.
- Use server scaled images, dont use css scaled images.
- Try to utilize HTML5 features such as local and session storage.
- Use HTTP/2 or SPDY protocol.
- Try to figure out the DNC look up delays.

## BACKEND OPTIMIZATIONS

### SERVER PROCESSING

#### 1 WEB SERVER
 - Use PHP7 and/or HHVM (HipHop Virtual Machine).
 - Use benchmarking tools to figure out the time consuming code.
#### 2 CACHE TYPES
 - Opcode caching. Cache compiled code for faster response. APC/ZendOpcode Caching
 - Memory caching techniques to process frequently accessed data. For example, Redis, memcached.
 - Application caching to store the processed templates.
 - Try to use background processing for heavier processes (sending emails, notification, calculations). For example, queuing system like RabbitMQ.
 - Review your system architecture may be use micro services/application architecture with SPAs on frontend.
#### 3 HOSTING OPTIONS
 - Load balancing
 - Website should be scalable and distributable
  - Do not use server bound sessions for example file based session storage.
  - Do not use server bound caching for example file based caching.
  - Remove code dependency.
  - Try to build independently host-able application module such as micro application architecture.
 #### 4 DATABASE
 - Optimize table, create indexes on frequently used columns in where conditions
 - Use SQL profiling tools to analyze and debug slow SQL queries
 - Try to use less joins in single database query.
 - Do not use sub queries because these are slower.
 - Try repairing the frequently accessed database tables.
 - Try database load balancing.
 - Try dropping unused database indexes.
