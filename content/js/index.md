## JavaScript

JavaScript short form JS is the general purpose programming language was first developed by Brendan Eich and was embedded into the Netscape navigator in 1995. Then the original author decided to submit this scripting language to the ECMA for maintaince and from there it is also known as ECMAScript. Decades before, its was considered to be best suitable for frontend website programming, for example, adding interaction to the web pages to make it more live and/or doing the form data validations. JS was also used to embed into several other technologies like PDF etc. Then Ryan Dahl a programmer came with a new technology called Node.JS and which changed the perspective of the web developers about JS and JS went on the server side as well. JavaScript is so much popular thesedays and is the necessary skill for every kind of web professional whether web designer, frontend programmer or backend programmer writing APIs or may be a desktop or mobile developer.

Having said that, it is very much clear and learning JavaScript is going to hike up your skill set. Here in this topic we will be covering the basics of the JavaScript. JavaScript have serveral considerable versions:

### JavaScript Versions
1. 5th Edition, in 2011
2. 6th Edition, in 2015 (originally known as ES6 or ECMAScript 6 but later on was changed the name to ES2015 to support yearly releases)
3. 7th Edition, in 2016 (ES2016)
4. 8th Edition, in 2017 (ES2017)

### Overview of the language features
JavaScript is a object based language everything in the language is an object. An object is an unordered collection of properties these properties can hold primitive types and other objects as values. The name of the properties are string they are called keys. The language supports few of the built-in objects like Math, Number, Date, RegExp, Function, Boolean, String, Array and a global object. All JavaScript programs always have a global object, in case of HTML document object model *window* is the global object.

Below are few of the terms that we use in the JavaScript with their definitions.

#### Objects
JavaScript is object based language and everything in the JavaScript is object. Every JavaScript program is a collection of object each communicating with each other. There are no classes in the JavaScript although new version of JS ES2015 allows to define classes but these are still wrapper for objects. Hence, inheritance in JavaScript is based on the special object property called *prototype*.

#### Primitive Types
These are the data types built in the language itself. The primitive types are undefined, null, number, string and boolean.

#### Constructor
An object that can create and initialize other objects such as functions are constructor. Each constructable object have a special hidden property called *prototype*.

#### Prototype
It is a property that hold the shared objects. Objects stored in the prototype of a constructable object is shared with its derived object means the objects created from its object.

#### Undefined
undefined is a primitive value that means nothing has been assigned to a variable.

#### Null
null is a primitive value that mean null, empty or non-existent value.

#### String
A string is a primitive value that consists of a finite lenght of zero or more unicode characters UTF-16.

#### Number
A number is a primitive value that presents a numeric value. JavaScript do not support the integers. All numbers in JavaScript are double precision float values and integers are formatted representation of float values.

#### NaN
NaN is a special value which represent **not a number**.
