**DRY** = Do not repeat yourself.

**KISS** = Keep it simple stupid. Do not over complicate it.

**Loose Coupling** = Code should not depend on other code, should be able to independently move.

**Maximum Cohesion** = Group together related code.

**Single responsibility** = One function, class, methods should only do one task not multiple tasks.

**Open/Close** = It should be extendable but must be freeze for modifications.

**Naming convention** =  should follow proper naming convention and stick to it.

**YAGNI (you are not goint to need it)** = Only add code when it is required.

**Reuse code** = Try to make resuable components. use traits, functions, libraries that can be reused.

**Separation of concern** = Code should be modularized based on distinct functionality.

**Avoid Premature Optimization** = Never think of optimizations until your code is working.


### Coding Guidelines
- Use batch statements where possible.
- Do not do heavy work inside loop bodies.
- Use proper data structure for easy retrival and storage.
- Do not overkill application with multiple 3rd party libraries.
- Use proper autoloading.


### SOLID
- S = Single responsibility principle.
- O = Open/close principle.
- L = Liskov substitution principle. (objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program)
- I = Interface segregation principle. (client-specific interface are good than one general purpose interface)
- D = Dependency inversion principle. (depend on abstractions not concretions)
